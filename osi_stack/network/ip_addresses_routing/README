Assignation using static IP's

A command for associating an ip address to an interface:
ip address add 192.168.0.2/24 dev "interface name"
			| 
			^
	example of ip address and mask used


This does configuration at level 3 (OSI STACK) , but it is not enough ! We need to follow the level 2 configuration of the interfaces:

ip link show dev "name of interface" (if the state is "DOWN" you need the following command

 ->' ip link set "name of interface" up '


To check the status of IP forwarding on a Linux system :
 -> sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

To change it:
-> sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 / 0


!!! In order for devices from different networks to communicate between them using the same router
they need to declare that router as "default gateway" : sudo ip route add default via "router_interface_ip"
